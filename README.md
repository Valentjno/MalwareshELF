Malwareshelf is a project created to make the possibility of malware analysis for ELF file open and available to the public. 

**Malwareshelf is open and welcoming visitors!**

If you are about to interact with our community please make sure to read our `CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md` prior to doing so. If you plan to contribute, first - thank you. However, do make sure to follow the standards on `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## Disclaimer
MalwareshELF's purpose is to allow the study of malware and enable people who are interested in malware analysis (or maybe even as a part of their job) to have access to live malware, analyse the ways they operate, and maybe even enable advanced and savvy  people to block specific malware within their own environment.

**Please remember that these are live and dangerous malware! They come encrypted and locked for a reason!  Do NOT run them unless you are absolutely sure of what you are doing! They are to be used only for educational purposes (and we mean that!) !!!**

We recommend running them in a VM which has no internet connection (or an internal virtual network if you must) and without guest additions or any equivalents. Some of them are worms and will automatically try to spread out. Running them unconstrained means that you **will infect yourself or others with vicious and dangerous malware!!!**

## Getting Started

## Documentation and Notes

### Background
MalwareShelf's objective is to offer a fast and easy way of retrieving malware samples and source code in an organized fashion in hopes of promoting malware research.

### Root Files

`/malware/Binaries` - The actual malwares samples - be careful! These are very live.

`/malware/Source` -  Malware source code.  

Malware under the folder `Original` is supposed to be (NO PROMISES!) the original source of the malware that leaked. Malware under the folder `Reversed` is either reversed, decompiled or partially reconstructed.


## Directory Structure:
Each directory is composed of 4 files:
- Malware files in an encrypted ZIP archive.
- SHA256 sum of the 1st file.
- MD5 sum of the 1st file.
- Password file for the archive.


## Bugs and Reports

The repository holding all files is currently
